00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,300
Welcome, this is my first time I'm talking at FOSDEM.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,880
You can follow along the slides via the link.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,680
By the time this airs I hope to be able to provide subtitles for download.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,900
The content will be close to speaker notes you can find either on the right hand
or at the bottom, depending on your screen.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,220
My name is André Jaenisch.
I'm currently working as Software Engineer at Jambit.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,920
It's a medium-sized software provider from Germany.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,740
This talk has nothing to do with my work.

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,840
Since this reveal.js presentation is pre-recorded using OBS Studio

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,420
please ask your questions at the end.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,540
In between you'll find scenes taken with ScreenCam on Android.

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,700
I'd welcome if you'd allow me to
add your comments to the presentation slides afterwards

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,340
Please tell me, if you want to opt-in.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,160
Let's start with Responsive Web Design!

15
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,880
I'm quite sure you ran into this picture in some form before.

16
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:14,240
It's a typical marketing image to depict a web app
that's usable on different devices by adjusting the layout accordingly.

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,240
… but …

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,860
What if I told you that this approach could fell short?

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,660
How would you classify this Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with a pen?

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,140
Is it a mobile?

21
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,260
It's small enough to get counted as one.

22
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,640
But you have a pointer device - the pen.

23
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,020
… so …

24
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,460
… designing for it like for a desktop?

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,540
You'd waste real screen estate otherwise after all.

26
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,100
While I was preparing for a Game Jam in early 2020 …

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,580
I ran across an article on Mozilla Developer Network
regarding Sensor APIs.

28
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,680
I was aware of the ability to recognise motion

29
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,480
and orientation

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,120
from my days with Firefox OS

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,720
but by now, there are more Sensor APIs available.

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,640
This talk will show you some tech demos.

33
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,360
They're not ready for production usage yet in general.

34
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:15,080
Since normally you'll need to toggle a flag in the browser to get access to the underlying API.

35
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,960
But that shouldn't stop you to show off what's possible on the web!

36
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,180
My first demo is called „What's the user doing?”

37
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,880
It's a showcase I run into years ago.

38
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,440
It highlights the impact on privacy sensor data can have.

39
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,177
You can see I can tell whether
the user is sitting, walking, taking a picture.

40
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:42,044
I was even able to test like I lay down the phone on the desk.

41
00:02:44,577 --> 00:02:51,155
This is normally not data you want to hand out without second thought.

42
00:02:52,444 --> 00:02:59,266
After my Game Jam I decided to create a small demo site
which runs some primitive checks on your device capabilities.

43
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:05,155
Note, that some of this is done with CSS and some of it is with JavaScript.

44
00:03:05,222 --> 00:03:10,911
so you have Media Query for example for the hover,
for detecting Pointer Devices, Aspect ratios

45
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,488
Colours, orientation.

46
00:03:13,644 --> 00:03:20,022
I'm not sure what colours is meant to do
but I can think of use cases for example for e-book readers.

47
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:28,844
Since I created the page I started to design tooltips based on
the hover Media Query instead of guessing from the screen size.

48
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,533
Orientation could be used if you have certain criteria.

49
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:40,733
For example, you have a sidebar which is needed and the thing you want to show is next to it.

50
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:47,622
Device Motion is the movement of a device in the room.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,688
Orientation is how you hold it.

52
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:56,688
Accelerometer measures the velocity.

53
00:03:57,222 --> 00:04:02,488
Ambient Light Level measures the relative light around the device.

54
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:05,311
I have a small demo for it.

55
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:09,666
Web Bluetooth is available on Chrome
but also only behind a flag.

56
00:04:10,844 --> 00:04:13,266
I've got something prepared for that for you.

57
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:17,800
Geolocation should be known from for example map apps.

58
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Gyroscope is a compass so to speak.
